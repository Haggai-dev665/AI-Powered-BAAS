SELECT *, ai_sentiment(bio) as sentiment, 
       ai_recommend_content(user_id) as recommendations 
FROM users WHERE id = $1;
```

#### **From AWS Amplify:**
```typescript
// Simplified migration from complex AWS setup
// Replace 50+ lines of AWS configuration with:
const aibaas = new AIBaaS({
  region: 'us-east-1',
  features: ['auth', 'database', 'storage', 'ai']
});

// Automatic AI enhancement of existing data
